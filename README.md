# uBO_Filterlist
Filterlist to block ads. It's specifically written for uBlock Origin, but still compatible with most ad blockers though some rules could only be detected by uBO. This filter list is written to cover websites which are mostly used in Iran, or other Farsi speaking countries, either Iranian or non-Iranian, that are not covered by other major filter lists. I try to keep it updated and efficient by removing obsolete rules and/or rules which are already added to other major lists.

## Note 
As a precaution, it is advisable to **disable** your Adblocker when you take **important steps** on trusted sites (bank portals, customer spaces, online shops, etc).

## Support 
In case of any unblocked advertisement, or false blocking, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/nimasaj/uBO_Filterlist/issues/new) and explain problem.

By using this filter list, one agrees that all responsibilities is solely on the user. Developers is just developing this filterlist as it is to improve his experience of web browsing, and does not take any responsibility of any type of damage/harm caused by using this filter list or uBO.
